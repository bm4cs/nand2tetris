I love computers. When I recently discovered that the [Nand2Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) guys, Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, had just packaged their famous course into a neat 12 week [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/nand2tetris1) package, I couldn't resist it any longer.

> In this course you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. Weâ€™ll take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn how really computers work, and how they are designed.
